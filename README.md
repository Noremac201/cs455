# Security Fundamentals

In the first phase of this project you did research about Steganography and found very interesting things.

Based on your research, in this phase-2 of the project, you are required to implement Image or Video Steganography. Not only that you would also demonstrate the use of AES-256. Implement any one Steganographic algorithm for hiding information inside a video or an image file (choose either video or image, not both).

Write a software program (s):

* that will hide your "x" bytes of data into an image/video file (Steganography).

* that will implement AES-256 encrypt, and encrypts your image/video file containing the hidden data. Send this encrypted file to another computer using email or whatever means (including Socket programming, if required I can provide file transfer code in Java, send me email to request this).

* that will implement AES-256 decrypt, and decrypts the downloaded file to get the original image/video file. Now extract the hidden data inside the image/video file and show it.

Use proper documentation styling so that your steps are clearly defined.
You are free to use any programming language you prefer. You are also allowed
to use any library for that programming language (like for AES), however you
have to write your own code for Steganography.

Prepare a report (a pdf file) with:

* problem description and adopted solution (algorithm) for Steganography.

* source code

* test cases

* what is that maximum number of "x" bytes of information that could be stored inside a given image (or video) without noticeably changing/distorting it. Also show that adding any more information would actually make it noticeable and thus defeat the purpose of hiding/secrecy

* related screenshots

* each team member's contribution
